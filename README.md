# A simple TableView entirely in code

Not quite slim enough to be a template. Just a great project to look at for new
developers looking to leave behind their storyboards and do it all in code.

Includes one ViewController which is a UITableViewController Subclass. All the
Delegates and DataSources are there.

The TableViewCells are properly dequeued using a reuse identifier.

And a custom cell class is there which toggles a checkmark when the cell is
selected.
